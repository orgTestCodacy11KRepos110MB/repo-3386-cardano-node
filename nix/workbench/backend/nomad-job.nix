  # https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/job-specification/template#left_delimiter
  # But those don't work to escape text to avoid HCL expressions interpolation.
  # We are using what says here:
  # "In both quoted and heredoc string expressions, Nomad supports template
  # sequences that begin with ${ and %{. These are described in more detail in
  # the following section. To include these sequences literally without
  # beginning a template sequence, double the leading character: $${ or %%{."
  # https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/job-specification/hcl2/expressions#string-literals
  escapeTemplate = str: builtins.replaceStrings ["\${" "%{"] ["\$\${" "%%{"] str;

  # About the JSON Job Specification and its odd assumptions:
  #
  # At least in Nomad version v1.4.3, the CLI command to submit new jobs
  # (https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/commands/job/run) says:
  # "Job files must conform to the job specification format." With this link:
  # https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/job-specification. This is the
  # HCL format that is heavily specified in the docs. Nice!
  #
  # But note that it starts saying "Nomad HCL is parsed in the command line and
  # sent to Nomad in JSON format via the HTTP API." and here there are the API
  # docs that have "JSON Job Specification" in its title:
  # https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/api-docs/json-jobs
  # well, this is the format that `nomad job run` expects if you use the `-json`
  # argument.
  #
  # I finally found this in the HCL overview page:
  # https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/job-specification/hcl2
  # "Since HCL is a superset of JSON, `nomad job run example.json` will attempt
  # to parse a JSON job using the HCL parser. However, the JSON format accepted
  # by the HCL parser is not the same as the API's JSON format. The HCL parser's
  # JSON format is unspecified, so the API format is preferred. You can use the
  # API format with the -json command line flag."
  #
  # So, if you don't provide the `-json` argument it expects HCL or its JSON
  # representation: https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/main/json/spec.md
  #
  # We are using what HashiCorp calls an unespecified format but it the same
  # format the SRE team is using.

  # The job stanza is the top-most configuration option in the job
